Observation in this ontology and O&M are described differently (O&M records an observation as an act/event), but they record the same thing and are essentially interchangeable.  The difference is in the ontological structure of the two, not the data or use.

Observation here records a Situation (the estimation of the value of a Property) and a description of the method that was used (along with the participants), while O&M interprets an Observation as the event itself; there must, however, have been an event that lead to our situation, so both are records of events.  The distinction is between the event itself and the record of what happened in that event.
